# GACOBOM
GaCoBoM (name is a work in progress) is a Games Comics Books Manager. 

This project is just an excuse for me to learn AngularJS, NodeJS and everything else I come across.

v0.0.1 

* Project Scaffolding. Some basic ideas, but may change later.
* Added client folder for the client AngularJS app
* Added server folder for the server NodeJS app
* Added provision folder for the provisioning shell scripts and config files
* Added Vagrant file configuration
* Added Nginx build script to build it with pagespeed. Not part of the provision script, must be installed after.
