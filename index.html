<p>GaCoBoM (name is a work in progress) is a Games Comics Books Manager. </p>

<p>This project is just an excuse for me to learn AngularJS, NodeJS and everything else I come across.</p>

<p><strong>v0.0.1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Project Scaffolding. Some basic ideas, but may change later.</li>
<li>Added client folder for the client AngularJS app</li>
<li>Added server folder for the server NodeJS app</li>
<li>Added provision folder for the provisioning shell scripts and config files</li>
<li>Added Vagrant file configuration</li>
<li>Added Nginx build script to build it with pagespeed. Not part of the provision script, must be installed after.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v0.0.2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Started playing with angular and angular-seed</li>
<li>Changed the default route for de nodejs requests so they can start in / and not in /app</li>
<li>Changed the routing of the static files so nginx can serve also .map files</li>
<li>Added twitter bootstrap</li>
<li>Added Default template using bootstrap</li>
<li>Added some view files and routing for books, comics and games</li>
<li>Added a listing of dummy games</li>
<li>Added a game cover without cover</li>
<li>Added a dummy counter for games, books and comics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added some angular logic, created controllers and factories for common functions and games</li>
<li>Added more static filetypes in nginx.conf</li>
<li>Added Angular-bootstrap for some bootstrap based angular components</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.4</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor some css clases to match a lowercase dash-delimited notation.</li>
<li>Added a template for games. Needs some work on the media elements and the covers for the games.</li>
<li>Added ngSanitize to sanitize HTML strings</li>
<li>Simplified the footer </li>
<li>Updated Angular to 1.4.6</li>
<li>Added NgResource (not used yet)</li>
<li>Added some dummy files in the server to test. Will be deleted once de server is running</li>
<li>Added some new routes in the server to support games and media</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.5</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Made some refactor to avoid the use of the # in the urls with html5mode</li>
<li>Changed the server config and split it into several files</li>
<li>Changed the provision script so the new config files are located were they belong</li>
<li>Now we have 2 nginx servers configured one for the static files and one for node</li>
<li>The one with the static files also redirects any request to index.html</li>
<li>The node server exposes the api on app.gacobom.com</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.6</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added constant for the api URL</li>
<li>Added 8 directives make the code of the game template more readable and reusable</li>
<li>Refactored the existing services to make them more readable</li>
<li>Added a txt file for the dummy files in the server</li>
<li>The structure of the game has been modified to reuse some components and to have the resources expose their urls</li>
<li>New route on the server to download the demo files.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.7</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor tu use ngResource on games.</li>
<li>Removed the error bit of the calls because its not implemented yet, it will be done later in a different way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.8</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added pagination to the games list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.9</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor of the game list to reuse with other media types</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.10</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added reusable splash screen based on <a href="https://github.com/popdevelop/angular-splash-demo">https://github.com/popdevelop/angular-splash-demo</a> (without the animations, maybe I'll add them later)</li>
<li>Added splash screens for covers and thumbnails</li>
<li>Removed unused css file</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v.0.0.11</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Changed the bootstrap script to:

<ul>
<li>Log all actions in /tmp/provision.log</li>
<li>Install nginx from development source</li>
<li>The script to compile nginx from source and add the pagespeed plugins is still usable if you want but I prefer to use this now because its faster</li>
<li>Upgraded nodejs to the latest version 4.x</li>
<li>Install pm2 as a process manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to a strange error if I use pm2 in the provision script to set the process of the node server, the server starts but I cant manage it with pm2. If I do it myself in the console everything works fine. So wile I look into this issue I'll leave the instructions of pm2 as a comment in the provision script.</p>
