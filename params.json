{"name":"Gacobom","tagline":"Game, Comic & eBook Manager","body":"# GACOBOM\r\nGaCoBoM (name is a work in progress) is a Games Comics Books Manager. \r\n\r\nThis project is just an excuse for me to learn AngularJS, NodeJS and everything else I come across.\r\n\r\n**v0.0.1**\r\n\r\n* Project Scaffolding. Some basic ideas, but may change later.\r\n* Added client folder for the client AngularJS app\r\n* Added server folder for the server NodeJS app\r\n* Added provision folder for the provisioning shell scripts and config files\r\n* Added Vagrant file configuration\r\n* Added Nginx build script to build it with pagespeed. Not part of the provision script, must be installed after.\r\n\r\n**v0.0.2**\r\n\r\n* Started playing with angular and angular-seed\r\n* Changed the default route for de nodejs requests so they can start in / and not in /app\r\n* Changed the routing of the static files so nginx can serve also .map files\r\n* Added twitter bootstrap\r\n* Added Default template using bootstrap\r\n* Added some view files and routing for books, comics and games\r\n* Added a listing of dummy games\r\n* Added a game cover without cover\r\n* Added a dummy counter for games, books and comics\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.3**\r\n\r\n* Added some angular logic, created controllers and factories for common functions and games\r\n* Added more static filetypes in nginx.conf\r\n* Added Angular-bootstrap for some bootstrap based angular components\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.4**\r\n\r\n* Refactor some css clases to match a lowercase dash-delimited notation.\r\n* Added a template for games. Needs some work on the media elements and the covers for the games.\r\n* Added ngSanitize to sanitize HTML strings\r\n* Simplified the footer \r\n* Updated Angular to 1.4.6\r\n* Added NgResource (not used yet)\r\n* Added some dummy files in the server to test. Will be deleted once de server is running\r\n* Added some new routes in the server to support games and media\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.5**\r\n\r\n* Made some refactor to avoid the use of the # in the urls with html5mode\r\n* Changed the server config and split it into several files\r\n* Changed the provision script so the new config files are located were they belong\r\n* Now we have 2 nginx servers configured one for the static files and one for node\r\n* The one with the static files also redirects any request to index.html\r\n* The node server exposes the api on app.gacobom.com\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.6**\r\n\r\n* Added constant for the api URL\r\n* Added 8 directives make the code of the game template more readable and reusable\r\n* Refactored the existing services to make them more readable\r\n* Added a txt file for the dummy files in the server\r\n* The structure of the game has been modified to reuse some components and to have the resources expose their urls\r\n* New route on the server to download the demo files.\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.7**\r\n\r\n* Refactor tu use ngResource on games.\r\n* Removed the error bit of the calls because its not implemented yet, it will be done later in a different way\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.8**\r\n\r\n* Added pagination to the games list\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.9**\r\n\r\n* Refactor of the game list to reuse with other media types\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.10**\r\n\r\n* Added reusable splash screen based on https://github.com/popdevelop/angular-splash-demo (without the animations, maybe I'll add them later)\r\n* Added splash screens for covers and thumbnails\r\n* Removed unused css file\r\n\r\n**v.0.0.11**\r\n\r\n* Changed the bootstrap script to:\r\n** Log all actions in /tmp/provision.log\r\n** Install nginx from development source\r\n** The script to compile nginx from source and add the pagespeed plugins is still usable if you want but I prefer to use this now because its faster\r\n** Upgraded nodejs to the latest version 4.x\r\n** Install pm2 as a process manager\r\n\r\nDue to a strange error if I use pm2 in the provision script to set the process of the node server, the server starts but I cant manage it with pm2. If I do it myself in the console everything works fine. So wile I look into this issue I'll leave the instructions of pm2 as a comment in the provision script.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-68442542-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
